1) first load by joblib PCA formed dataset with 3features that already been preprocessed and removed outliers
2) ask user 3 features for input and before giving to model do label encoding and standard scalar with joblib then model with joblib predit 
3) then the full tuple is stored in empty dataset which lenght is high 
4) stack or join these together  dataset 
5) make real time analyssis graph on them
