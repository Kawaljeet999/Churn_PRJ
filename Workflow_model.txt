1) Retrivel of data Set Doing some basic pandas operation/function
2) Profiling of data
3) Data Preprocessing 
   --> a) Remove missing value both numeric and Categorial 
   --> b) Fit the missing value using Simple imputer
   --> c) Save dataset
   --> d) Split Data in train and test
   --> e) Feature Scaling 
   --> f) Startified Shuffle
   --> g) Split data and label seperately for model training
4) EDA
   --> Visualization both matplotlib and Seaborn what you know 
   --> Also you use boxplot best to find outliers(Anomaly)
5) Feature Engeenering
   --> Do pearson correlation for making correlation matrix heatmap
   --> Apply PCA for data reduction
6) Model Selection
   --> Train model on some data from original set and also extract labels from original set 
   --> Apply pipeline has simple imputer and feature scaling and then do Prediction on some data
7) Metrics
   --> Accuracy score and F1 score for Classifictaion  
   --> Mean square error for regression
8) Cross validation
9) Fine tuning
10) Make a classification report
11) Save and use model for test data
12) get accuracy and F1 scoore for test data
